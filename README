This project is for converting is the code a transit 'signup' from the
Metropolitan Tulsa Transit Authority (MTTA) into a General Transit Feed
Specification (GTFS), that can be used with other transit software such as
OpenTripPlanner.  Our goal is to get this data onto Google Maps and any other
publicly available transit database.

To run the project:

1. Install python, pip, virtualenv, and virtualenvwrapper
2. Run `mkvirtualenv ttg` to create the new virtualenv
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download the third-party libraries
4. Get a copy of the Tulsa Transit Authority's signup data.  It should be a zip file.
5. Change to the `ttgsite` folder, copy `local_settings.example.py` to `local_settings.py`, change as needed.
6. Back in the main folder, run `./manage.py syncdb; ./manage.py migrate` to create a new database.
6. Run `./manage.py importmttasignup signup.zip` to import into SignUp #1
6. Run `./manage.py copymttatogtfs 1` to copy SignUp #1 to Feed #1 
7. Run `./manage.py exportgtfs --name feed.zip 1` to export Feed #1 to feed.zip
8. Run `feedvalidator.py feed.zip` to validate the feed
9. Run `schedule_viewer.py feed.zip` to view the schedule
10. Run `/manage.py runserver` to start up Django.  The Django admin may be the only interesting part.

Required files for this project
===============================
You'll need a signup file from the Tulsa Transit Authority to populate your
database.  Contact John Whitlock or Luke Crouch to get a copy.

In March 2013, the Patterns shape file format changed, and dbfpy can not
read it.  To import recent signups, you'll need to extract the zip file,
load patterns.dbf in OpenOffice, and re-save it.  Other files can still be
read w/o modification.  GDAL can read the patterns file, so a switch to
GeoDjango is in our future.
